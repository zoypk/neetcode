#
# Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all
# overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals
# that cover all the intervals in the input.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into
# [1,6].
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
# Output: [[1,5]]
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
# Output: [[1,7]]
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4
#

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda i: i[0])
        output = [intervals[0]]

        for start, end in intervals:
            lastEnd = output[-1][1]
            if start <= lastEnd:
                output[-1][1] = max(end, lastEnd)
            else:
                output.append([start, end])
        return output
