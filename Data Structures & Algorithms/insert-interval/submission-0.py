# Testcase Example:  '[[1,3],[6,9]]\n[2,5]'
#
# You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where
# intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the i^th
# interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also
# given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and
# end of another interval.
#
# Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in
# ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping
# intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
#
# Return intervals after the insertion.
#
# Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new
# array and return it.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
# Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
# Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
# Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with
# [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^5
# intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
# newInterval.length == 2
# 0 <= start <= end <= 10^5

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: list[list[int]], newInterval: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:

        res = []

        # so first we need to find where the overlap is
        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if newInterval[1] < intervals[i][0]:  # If the new intervel is before the ith interval
                res.append(newInterval)
                return res + intervals[i:]
            elif newInterval[0] > intervals[i][1]:
                res.append(intervals[i])
            else:
                newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]), max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])]

        res.append(newInterval)

        return res
